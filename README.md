Animal Classification Dataset

This repository contains a dataset for animal classification sourced from Kaggle, used in a machine learning project. It includes labeled images of various animal species.

Dataset Origin

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle and is organized into four folders, each containing 1000 images per animal:

- Buffalo
- Elephant
- Rhino
- Zebra

Repository Contents

The repository includes categorized images in the Data/ directory, Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ for exploration and modeling, and a requirements.txt file listing necessary dependencies.

Project Overview

The project involves collecting, preparing, and modeling data for animal species classification using convolutional neural networks.

Usage

1. Clone the Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Jesuscft/Animal-Classification.git
   cd Animal-Classification

2. Install Dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Explore and Model:

   Use the Jupyter notebooks in **notebooks/** to explore and train models for animal species classification.

Contributions

Contributions to enhance the dataset, implement additional models, or improve Jupyter notebooks are welcome.
